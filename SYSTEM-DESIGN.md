Below is a visual diagram description you can import into Figma manually or replicate using nodes and connectors.

**ATS System Design Diagram**

```plaintext
[Frontend: Candidate / Recruiter]
    │ Upload Resume / Job Description
    ▼
[API Layer (FastAPI / Flask)]
    │ Orchestrates pipeline, handles requests
    ▼
[Parsing Layer]
    │ Extract text from PDF/DOCX
    │ Split sections (Skills, Experience, Education)
    │ Clean and normalize text
    ▼
[Skill Extraction Layer]
    │ NER / Keyword Extraction
    │ Normalize skills, tools, certifications
    ▼
[Embedding Layer]
    │ Generate embeddings for Resume, JD, and Skills
    │ (Sentence-BERT / OpenAI)
    ▼
[Vector Database / Similarity Engine]
    │ Store embeddings (FAISS / Pinecone)
    │ Compute cosine similarity
    │ Identify missing skills via vector matching
    ▼
[Weighted Scoring Engine]
    │ Combine:
    │  - Semantic similarity (50%)
    │  - Skill match ratio (30%)
    │  - Experience & Education (20%)
    │ Output ATS Score (0–100)
    ▼
[Explanation Layer (LLM)]
    │ Generate textual reasoning for score
    │ e.g., "Matched 81% of skills; missing AWS, Kubernetes"
    ▼
[Frontend Display]
    │ Show ATS Score, Missing Skills, and Feedback
    ▼
[Storage Layer: PostgreSQL / MongoDB]
    │ Store parsed data, embeddings, scores, logs
    ▼
[Compliance Layer: GDPR / DPDP]
    │ Strip PII, log consent, anonymize data
    │ Handle deletion requests
```

**Data Flow Summary**:

1. Candidate/Recruiter uploads → API triggers pipeline.
2. Text parsing & cleaning.
3. Skills extracted from both resume & JD.
4. Embeddings created → stored in Vector DB.
5. Cosine similarity & missing skills computed.
6. ATS score generated by Weighted Engine.
7. Optional LLM produces human-readable explanation.
8. Results displayed & logged with compliance handling.

Use Figma nodes and arrows to connect these layers horizontally for main flow and vertically for compliance/storage links.
